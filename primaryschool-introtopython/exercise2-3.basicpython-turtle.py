Caterpillar

Use the commands youâ€™ve learned so far to draw a caterpillar on your canvas.
Make sure your caterpillar:

has a body that consists of 5 circles
each circle has a radius of 20
Hint: In order to line circles up next to each other,
between circles, think about how far Tracy is going to need to move forward.
You may want to sketch this program out before writing the code!
