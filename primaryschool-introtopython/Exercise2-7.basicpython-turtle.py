'''Exercise : 4 Columns 2.0
Use for loops to enhance the ‘4 Columns’ program you wrote in our last lesson.
Remember:

Your entire code does not have to be a part of your loop
Pay careful attention to your indentation!
Hint: Send Tracy from her home in the center to her
starting position to draw your lines and then write your loop to draw all three!
